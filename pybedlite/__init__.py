Examples of Writing BED files

Module Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module contains the following public classes:

    - :class:`~pybedlite.bed_record.BedStrand` -- Enumeration of possible strands for a bed record
    - :class:`~pybedlite.bed_record.BedRecord` -- Lightweight class for storing information
        pertaining to a BED record.
    - :class:`~pybedlite.bed_source.BedSource` -- Reader class for parsing BED files and iterate
        over their contained records
    - :class:`~pybedlite.bed_writer.BedWriter` -- Writer class for writing BED files

The module contains the following methods:

    - :func:`pybedlite.reader` -- opens a BED file for reading.
    - :func:`pybedlite.writer` -- opens a BED file for writing.
