# pybedlite

See documentation on [pybedlite.readthedocs.org][rtd-link].

```
conda install -c bioconda pybedlite
```
OR
```
conda create -n pybedlite pybedlite
conda activate pybedlite
```

Note that while there is a version of pybedlite on pypi versions of pybedlite >=
0.0.2 cannot at present be installed via pypi because they have dependencies
that preclude publishing to pypi. For this reason installation via conda is
required.

[rtd-link]:    http://pybedlite.readthedocs.org/en/stable

**Requires python 3.8+** (for python < 3.8, please use pybedlite <= 0.0.3)

# Getting Setup for Development Work

[Poetry][poetry-link] is used to manage the python development environment. 

A simple way to create an environment with the desired version of python and poetry is to use [conda][conda-link].  E.g.:

```bash
conda create -n pybedlite python=3.8 poetry
conda activate pybedlite
poetry install
```

If the methods listed above do not work try the following:
```bash
mamba create -n pybedlite -c conda-forge "python=3.9.16" "poetry=1.6.1"
mamba activate pybedlite
poetry install
```

If, during `poetry install` on Mac OS X errors are encountered running gcc/clang to build `pybedtools` or other packages with native code, try setting the following and re-running `poetry install`:
```bash
export CFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"
```

## Checking the Build
### Run all checks with:
```bash
./ci/check.sh
```
